## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours

let userName = "Manvi Singhal"
print("The Username remains a constant value and it does not change with time")
var age = 19
print("The user's age is a dynamic value that varies each year")
var numberOfSteps = 7872
print("The number of steps taken is a dynamic value that gets updated every second")
let goalNumberOfSteps = 10000
print("The goal number of steps is a constant value that is a set goal to be achieved that day")
var averageHeartRate = 72
print("The average heart rate over the last 24 hrs is an average value that depends on the day-to-day activities")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
